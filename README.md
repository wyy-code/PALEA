# Potential Isomorphism Propagation Entity Alignment
Paper for 2024

This is the code of PipEA introduced in our paper, which is based on PEEA encoder.

## Datasets

The dataset can be unzipped by data.zip in your root.

* ref_ent_ids: testing entity pairs;
* triples_1: relation triples encoded by ids in source KG;
* triples_2: relation triples encoded by ids in target KG;


## Just run main.py
